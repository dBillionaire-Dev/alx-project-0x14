MoviesDatabase API IntegrationThis README.md provides an overview of integrating with the MoviesDatabase API, based on the publicly available documentation on RapidAPI, specifically for the /titles/{id}/main_actors endpoint.API OverviewThe MoviesDatabase API allows developers to programmatically access movie-related data. Based on the currently available documentation, its primary feature is retrieving information about movie titles, such as the main actors associated with a given film. This enables applications to enrich their movie content with cast details programmatically.API VersionThe specific version of the MoviesDatabase API is not explicitly stated in the provided documentation snippet (RapidAPI playground). Developers should refer to the main RapidAPI listing for the MoviesDatabase API for official versioning information if available.Available EndpointsBased on the provided documentation, the main available endpoint is:GET /titles/{id}/main_actors: Retrieves a list of main actors for a specific movie title.Description: This endpoint takes a movie's IMDb ID and returns data pertaining to its primary cast members.Note: The provided documentation primarily details this single endpoint. Other endpoints or broader API functionality are not covered in the linked RapidAPI playground snippet.Request and Response FormatRequest FormatA typical request to the GET /titles/{id}/main_actors endpoint involves:HTTP Method: GETURL Structure: https://moviesdatabase.p.rapidapi.com/titles/{id}/main_actorsPath Parameters:id (string, required): The IMDb ID of the movie title (e.g., tt0111161 for "The Shawshank Redemption").Example Request (conceptual cURL):curl --request GET \
     --url 'https://moviesdatabase.p.rapidapi.com/titles/tt0111161/main_actors' \
     --header 'X-RapidAPI-Host: moviesdatabase.p.rapidapi.com' \
     --header 'X-RapidAPI-Key: YOUR_RAPIDAPI_KEY'
Response FormatThe API typically responds with a JSON object. For the GET /titles/{id}/main_actors endpoint, a successful response usually contains a results array, where each element represents a main actor with details such as their id, name, and potentially characters they played in the movie.Example Successful Response (JSON):{
  "results": [
    {
      "id": "nm0000168",
      "name": "Tim Robbins",
      "characters": [
        {
          "name": "Andy Dufresne"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "nm0000305",
      "name": "Morgan Freeman",
      "characters": [
        {
          "name": "Ellis Boyd 'Red' Redding"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "nm0000854",
      "name": "Bob Gunton",
      "characters": [
        {
          "name": "Warden Norton"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
AuthenticationAuthentication for the MoviesDatabase API on RapidAPI typically requires two headers:X-RapidAPI-Host: moviesdatabase.p.rapidapi.com (This identifies the API host)X-RapidAPI-Key: YOUR_RAPIDAPI_KEY (This is your unique API key obtained from RapidAPI after subscribing to the API).These headers must be included with every request to authenticate and authorize your access.Error HandlingWhile the provided documentation snippet does not detail specific error codes, common API error responses generally include:400 Bad Request: Indicating that the request was malformed (e.g., incorrect id format).401 Unauthorized: If your X-RapidAPI-Key is missing or invalid.403 Forbidden: If your API key does not have the necessary permissions or if usage limits are exceeded (though rate limit specific errors might be different).404 Not Found: If the requested resource (e.g., a movie with the given IMDb ID) does not exist.500 Internal Server Error: A generic error indicating a problem on the API's side.It's recommended to implement proper error handling in your code to gracefully manage these scenarios, often by checking the HTTP status code and parsing any error messages provided in the response body.Usage Limits and Best PracticesUsage Limits: The specific usage limits (e.g., number of requests per day/month, rate limits per second) for the MoviesDatabase API are not explicitly detailed in the provided documentation snippet. You should refer to the API's pricing and plans section on its main RapidAPI page (https://rapidapi.com/SAdrian/api/moviesdatabase/) for accurate and up-to-date information on limits.Best Practices:Handle Errors Gracefully: Always anticipate and handle potential API errors (network issues, invalid inputs, rate limits, server errors).Cache Data: To reduce API calls and improve performance, consider caching responses, especially for data that doesn't change frequently.Respect Rate Limits: If usage limits are provided, implement mechanisms (e.g., exponential backoff) to avoid exceeding them, which could lead to temporary bans or request failures.Secure API Keys: Never hardcode your X-RapidAPI-Key directly in client-side code. Use environment variables or a secure server-side proxy to manage your API key.Validate Inputs: Ensure that any input provided by users to your application (e.g., a movie ID) is validated before being sent to the API.
